  /**
   *   1. Implement a countdown latch using `Ref` and `Promise`. A countdown
   *      latch is a synchronization aid that allows one or more threads to wait
   *      until a set of operations being performed in other threads completes.
   *      The latch is initialized with a given count, and the count is
   *      decremented each time an operation completes. When the count reaches
   *      zero, all waiting threads are released:
   *
   *     ```scala mdoc:invisible
   *     trait CountDownLatch {
   *       def countDown: UIO[Unit]
   *       def await: UIO[Unit]
   *     }
   *
   *     object CountDownLatch {
   *       def make(n: Int): UIO[CountDownLatch] = ???
   *     }
   *     ```
   */

  package CountDownLatchImpl {

  }

  /**
   *   2. Similar to the previous exercise, you can implement `CyclicBarrier`. A
   *      cyclic barrier is a synchronization aid that allows a set of threads
   *      to all wait for each other to reach a common barrier point. Once all
   *      threads have reached the barrier, they can proceed:
   *
   *     ```scala mdoc:invisible
   *     trait CyclicBarrier {
   *       def await: UIO[Unit]
   *       def reset: UIO[Unit]
   *     }
   *
   *     object CyclicBarrier {
   *       def make(parties: Int): UIO[CyclicBarrier] = ???
   *     }
   * ```
   */
  package CyclicBarrierImpl {


  }

  /**
   *   3. Implement a concurrent bounded queue using `Ref` and `Promise`. It
   *      should support enqueueing and dequeueing operations, blocking when the
   *      queue is full or empty:
   *
   *     ```scala
   *     trait Queue[A] {
   *       def offer(a: A): UIO[Unit]
   *       def take: UIO[A]
   *     }
   *
   *     object Queue {
   *       def make[A](capacity: Int): UIO[Queue[A]] = ???
   *     }
   *     ```
   */

  // Please note that this is an educational implementation and may not be
  // suitable for production use. If you want a well-tested and robust
  // implementation, consider using the `zio.Queue.bounded` provided by ZIO.
